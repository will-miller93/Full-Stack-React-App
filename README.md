# Full Stack React Reading List App

## Over View
This is a pretty simple app. When you load the page you have two sections, the first a form that promts you to input data (Book Name, Author, and synopsis). When you enter this data and click the 'Submit Book' button it will add everything you added to the book list. 

in the second section you see either a blank page or a list of books that you have added. After you add a book to the list you now have the option to click on the title and see all of the information that was included.
